# group-13 Project

*Rough Draft*

Allows the user to interact with a visualization of the orbital radius as a function of radius for the Milky Way galaxy.
- Triaxial NFW Potential
- Plummer Potential
- Exponential Potential

Each potential has parameters the user can adjust to compare their simulated velocity profile with the observed velocity profile.
